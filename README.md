I built a lockbox with a latching solenoid which only opens during certain times throughout the week.  
This helped my roomates and I to stay focued on school since we could lock the TV remote in the box, and only watch TV late in the evenings when the box was open.
Shown below is a picture of my lockbox hardware, with the links to the parts used.
